The settings.gradle file plays a fundamental role in Android Studio projects, particularly in
managing which modules are part of your project build. It is the entry point where the Gradle
build system identifies all modules that make up the project. This file must list each module
explicitly so that Gradle knows to include them in the build process.

When you add multiple module to the project then the file contains like this;
include ':app', ':library', ':feature'

By default, the project name is derived from the directory name. You can override it in
settings.gradle:

// settings.gradle
rootProject.name = "MyAwesomeProject"

Defining Custom Module Paths:
If your module folders are not in the root directory, you can specify their paths:

// settings.gradle
include(":app", ":library", ":feature")
project(":library").projectDir = File("custom/path/to/library")
