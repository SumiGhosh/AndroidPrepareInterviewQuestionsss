It’s all about protecting your privacy and keeping your information safe.

App permissions help protect your privacy by controlling access to:

Your personal stuff, like your contacts and system settings.
Actions that could affect your privacy, such as recording audio or connecting to other devices.
Important features of your phone, like the camera, GPS, and microphone.
Communication tools, such as sending texts or making calls.
Hardware features, like Bluetooth and Wi-Fi connections.

Some permissions are granted automatically upon installation, known as install-time permissions.
In contrast, there are runtime permissions that require your app to actively request permission
from the user during runtime to proceed with certain actions or data access.

1. Install-time permissions
Install-time permissions give your app limited access to restricted data or let your app perform
restricted actions that minimally affect the system or other apps. When you declare install-time
permissions in your app, an app store presents an install-time permission notice to the user when
they view an app’s details page. The system automatically grants your app the permissions when the
user installs your app.

Other:
Recieve data from network
view network connections
full network access
prevent device from sleeping

1. Normal Permissions: These permissions enable access to data and functionalities beyond the
app’s sandbox, posing minimal risk to user privacy or other apps’ operation.

Examples of normal permissions include:

ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE: Allows your app to check the network state (e.g., whether the device is
connected to Wi-Fi or mobile data).
INTERNET: Enables internet access for fetching data or communicating with servers.
VIBRATE: Allows your app to vibrate the device.
WAKE_LOCK: Lets your app keep the device awake while performing specific tasks.


2. Signature Permissions: Granted solely to apps signed by the same certificate as the app or
operating system defining the permission. Example:

Suppose your app provides a custom autofill service. To access this service, other apps must be
signed with the same certificate as your app. This ensures that only trusted apps can use your
autofill service.

2. Runtime permissions
Runtime permissions, also called dangerous permissions, give your app more control over sensitive
data or actions that can affect your device and other apps. To use these permissions, you need to
ask the user for permission each time before accessing the data or performing actions. Don’t assume
you have permission already — always ask the user for it when needed.

When your app requests a runtime permission, the system presents a runtime permission prompt.

Examples:

Camera Permission: Required for taking photos, recording videos, and streaming live video within
the app.
Location Permission: This allows your app to access the device’s location for services like maps,
navigation, and location-based features.
Contacts Permission: Enables your app to read or write contact information.

3. Special permissions
Special permissions are tied to specific tasks within an app. They’re set by the platform and device
 makers, usually to safeguard powerful actions like drawing over other apps. These permissions cover
 areas that require more protection and involve system-level tasks or sensitive data.

In your phone’s settings, the “Special app access” section holds features you can turn on or off.
These often correspond to special permissions.

Examples:

Body Sensors Permission: Allows access to health data and step count from paired heart-rate
monitors, fitness trackers, and other sensors.
Calendar Permission: Let apps read, create, edit, or delete calendar events.
Call Logs Permission: Allows reading and writing phone call logs.
