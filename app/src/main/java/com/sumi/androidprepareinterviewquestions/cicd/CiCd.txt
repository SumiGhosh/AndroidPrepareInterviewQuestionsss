CI (Continuous Integration)
* Automatically integrates code changes from multiple contributors into a shared repository
several times a day.
* Each merge triggers an automated build process.
* Automated tests(unit tests, integration tests) are run against the build.
* Primary goal is to detect integration errors quickly and ensure the codebase is always in a
working state.

CD (Continuous Delivery)
* This builds upon CI.
* After code is successfully built and passes all automated tests in CI, it's automatically released
to a "staging" or "pre-production" environment.
* In continuous delivery, there is a manual approval step before the changes are pushed to the
live production environment.
* Ensures that every change that passes the tests is avail for release at any time

CD (Continuous Deployment)
* Same procedures, except here manual approval is not required, once the test cases are passed the changes are automatically
deployed to the production environment.
